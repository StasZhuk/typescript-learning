<p>The remaining lectures in this module are from the original version of this course.</p><p>When I first recorded the course, there was no official TS support built-into create-react-app.</p><p>Therefore, the remaining lectures show you an alternative setup approach that does not use create-react-app. Might definitely be interesting but won't be required unless you really want to configure everything on your own.</p>
